License information can be found in the dwm-5.8.2.tar.gz and in src/dwm-5.8.2/LICENSE.
I take no credit for writing any of this. All that I have done is put it all together and maybe changed a few lines of code to get things to play nicely.


== WHAT IS JDWM?
This is basically just a copy of my own DWM setup on my Arch Linux desktop: PKGBUILD and all. Perfect for Arch users who want a to get DWM setup with a bunch of the popular community patches.
I personally use a font that I've created called ProFontSymbols that is ProFont but altered so that a few useless unicode characters are now copies of popular .xbm icons used with dzen2.
Basically, it cheats and gives you icons in the DWM statusbar.

== HOW DOES I JDWM?
Edit the config.h in the main directory because the PKGBUILD script copies that one over top of the config.h in the src dir.
