JDWM is DWM 5.8.2 with popular community patches already applied.
http://dwm.suckless.org/

This is basically just a copy of my own DWM setup on my Arch Linux desktop.
PKGBUILD and all.

Edit the config.h in the main directory because the PKGBUILD script copies that one over top of the config.h in the src dir.

You'll also notice I have left in examples of my custom hotkeys and font.
The font can be found at https://github.com/JimmyZelinskie/ProFontSymbols

With the application of pango and this font, you are able to achieve unicode characters of other languages and still use the ProFont font with custom glyphs to use in the DWM statusbar.

I take no credit for writing any of this. All that I have done is put it all together and maybe changed a few lines of code to get things to play nicely.
